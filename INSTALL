compilation is not fully automated yet.
Here is the order of things you need to compile

1) iniparser3.db  located in src.lib

2) the ros server located in src.bin

3) all the drivers you want to run located in src.bin

4) server and drivers will be placed in the bin directory

Note: by default the ros server is configured to not require any drivers 
to operate and it should respond to controlprogram commands with error status 
messages for some commands and should not lock up or fault if drivers are not present.

However when running at a radar site, it is advisable to reconfigure the ros server 
to exit if one of the required drivers is not running.
