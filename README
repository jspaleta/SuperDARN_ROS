This is an initial start for a public git tree for the new SuperDARN ROS.
This repository will grow to hold ros server process and related driver code for different SuperDARN radar site hardware configurations.

The focus of this work is define a set of slowly evovling TCP intefaces between
controlprograms, the ros server, and the hardware drivers in a way that allows people to work on enhancing the capabilities and performance of of any part of the software stack using a mimic radar configuration that uses the same TCP API as all the radars running this version of the ROS.

We start with a set of dummy drivers not attached to any hardware 
that will compile cleanly on both Linux and QNX6. These drivers can 
serve as a starting point for development of site specific drivers.

In additional there are set of simple diagnostic controlprogram clients for simple testing.
