This is an initial start for a public git tree for the new SuperDARN ROS.
This repository will grow to hold ros server process and related driver 
code for different SuperDARN radar site hardware configurations.

The focus of this work is define a set of slowly evovling TCP interfaces between
controlprograms, the ros server, and the hardware drivers. These interfaces are 
meant to allow people to work on enhancing the capabilities and performance of 
any part of the software stack using a mimic radar configuration as well as bringing
site specific capability online that controlprogram can optional use without
knowing any details of the site hardware ahead of time.

We start with a set of dummy drivers not attached to any hardware 
that will compile cleanly on both Linux and QNX6. These drivers can 
serve as a starting point for development of site specific drivers.

In additional there are set of simple diagnostic controlprogram clients for simple 
testing.  These diagnostic programs do not use the rst libraries nor do they provide 
any processing of the raw data stream.  They are meant for diagnosing ros server 
operation and to give site operators some usable examples from which to build 
site libraries for controlprograms to rely on.
