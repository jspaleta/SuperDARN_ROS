This directory holds _example_ site data files. It is expected that site operators will need to edit these files and extend them based on their own needs for the hardware they are running.

The site.ini here will appropriate to run with the ros server using the fake hardware drivers that are included.  

Note, no variable in the site.ini is _required_. Each keyvalue pair that 
is present will override a default value.  

It is also possible to include keyvalues that the ROS server and the drivers know
nothing about that are entirely informative from a site operations point of view.

In the future it will be possible to ask the ROS and drivers for all the keyvalues 
that it requires with the default values in use.
